   <p> The 2004 Residential Tenancies act gives every landlord and tenant a right to a rent review once each year.  </p>
        <p>  The Act makes it illegal for a landlord to charge a rent higher than the market rent.</p>
        <p>  If there is a dispute about the market rent, either the landlord or the tenant can take a case to the Private Residential Tenancies Board (the PTRB).</p>
        <p>  The problem with this system is in establishing an objective way of determining the market rent of a property.</p>
        <p>  The purpose of myrent is to gather information on rents from landlords and tenants and allow any registered user to generate a report on the state of the rental market.</p>
        <p>  The success of the project will depend on the willingness of tenants and landlords to provide information about their properties.</p>
